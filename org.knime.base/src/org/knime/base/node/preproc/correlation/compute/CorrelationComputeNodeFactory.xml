	<name>Linear Correlation</name>
	<shortDescription>
		Computes correlation coefficients for pairs of numeric or
		nominal columns.
	</shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			<p>
				Calculates for each pair of selected columns a correlation
				coefficient, i.e. a measure of the correlation of the two variables.
	    </p>
			<p>
				Which correlation measure is applied depends on the types of the
				underlying variables:
				<br />
				<tt>numeric &lt;-&gt; numeric</tt>:
				<a
					href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_product-moment_correlation_coefficient">
					Pearson's product-moment coefficient</a>.
				Missing values in a column are ignored in such a way that for the
				computation of the correlation between two columns only complete
				records are taken into account. For instance, if there are three
				columns A, B and C and a row contains a missing value in column A
				but not in B and C, then the row will be ignored for computing the
				correlation between (A, B) and (A, C). It will not be ignored for
				the correlation between (B, C). This corresponds to the function
				<i>cor(&lt;data.frame&gt;, use="pairwise.complete.obs")</i>
				in the R statistics package.
				<br />
				The value of this measure ranges from -1 (strong negative 
				correlation) to 1 (strong positive correlation). A value of 0
				represents no linear correlation (the columns might still be
				highly dependent on each other, though).
				<br />
				<tt>nominal &lt;-&gt; nominal</tt>:
				<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson%27s_chi-square_test">
					Pearson's chi square test on the contingency table</a>. 
			    This value is then normalized to a range [0,1] using
				<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cram%C3%A9r%27s_V">
					Cramer's V</a>, whereby 0 represents no correlation and 1 
			    a strong correlation. Missing values in nominal columns are
			    treated such as they were a self-contained possible value. 
			    If one of the two columns contains more possible values than
			    specified in the dialog (default 50), the correlation will not
			    be computed.
                <br />
				Correlation measures for other pairs of columns are not
				available, they are represented by missing values in the output
				table and crosses in the accompanying view.
