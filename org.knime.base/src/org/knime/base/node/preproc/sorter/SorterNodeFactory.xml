    <fullDescription>
        <intro>
			This node sorts the rows according to user-defined criteria. In the dialog, select 
		    the columns according to which the data should be sorted. Also select
		    whether it should be sorted in ascending or descending order.
		</intro>
		<option name="Add sorting criterion">
			Allows to refine the sorting by adding additional sorting criteria.
		</option>
		<option name="Sort in memory">
			If selected the table is sorted in memory which requires more memory, but is faster. In case the input table
			is large and memory is scarce it is recommended not to check this option. 
		</option>
		<option name="Move Missing Cells to end of sorted list">If selected missing
		values are always placed at the end of the sorted output. This is
		independent of the sort order, i.e. if sorted ascendingly they are 
		considered to be larger than a non-missing value and if sorted descendingly
		they are smaller than any non-missing value.</option>
