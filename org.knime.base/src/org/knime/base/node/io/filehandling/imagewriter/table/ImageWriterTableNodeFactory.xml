	<name>Image Writer Table LS</name>
	<shortDescription>Writes all images from a specific column to a directory.</shortDescription>
	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			This node takes all images in a certain column of the input table and writes them, each as a separate
			file, into a directory. It will append the paths of the written files to the 
			input table as well as the corresponding write status (created, unmodified, overwritten).
		</intro>
		<option name="Image">
			Options for selecting an image column from the input table and whether the original image column 
			should be included in the output or not.
			<ul>
				<li>
					<b>Column: </b>
					Column containing the images to write.
					<br />
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Remove image column: </b>
					If checked the column containing the images is removed from the output table.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</option>
		<option name="File names">
        	Select an option for the image file names, by default files will be generated using the "File_?" pattern. 
        	There are two options to choose from. 
			<ul>
				<li>
					<b>Generate: </b>
					The file names will be generated using the provided pattern. The pattern must contain a single "?" 
					symbol. This symbol will, during execution, be replaced by an incrementing counter to make the
					filenames unique. The file extension will be detected automatically and must not be specified.
					<br />
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>From column: </b>
					Allows to select a column containing the file names under which the corresponding image file
					will be stored. 
				</li>
			</ul>
        </option>
		<option name="Write to">
			Select a file system in which you want to store the files. There
			are three default file system options to choose from:
			<br />
			<ul>
				<li>
					<i>Local File System:</i>
					Allows you to select a location in your local system.
				</li>
				<li>
					<i>Mountpoint:</i>
					Allows you to read from a mountpoint. When selected, a new drop-down
					menu appears to choose the mountpoint. Unconnected mountpoints are
					greyed out but can still be selected (note that browsing is disabled
					in this case). Go to the KNIME Explorer and connect to the
					mountpoint to enable browsing.
					A mountpoint is displayed in red if it was previously selected but
					is no longer available. You won't be able to save the dialog as long as you don't 
					select a valid i.e. known mountpoint.
				</li>
				<li>
					<i>Relative to:</i>
					Allows you to choose whether to resolve the path
					relative to the current mountpoint, current workflow or the current
					workflow's data area. When selected a new drop-down menu appears to choose which of
					the three options to use.
				</li>
			</ul>
			It is possible to use other file systems with this node. Therefore,
			you have to enable the file system connection input port of this node
			by clicking the
			<b>...</b>
			in the bottom left corner of the node's icon and choose
			<i>Add File System Connection port</i>
			.
			<br />
			Afterwards, you can simply connect the desired connector node to this
			node. The file system connection will then be shown in the drop-down
			menu. It is greyed out if the file system is not connected in which
			case you have to (re)execute the connector node first.
			Note: The default file systems listed above can't be selected if a file
			system is provided via the input port.
		</option>
		<option name="Folder">
			Enter a path to a folder. The required syntax of a path
			depends on the chosen file system, such as &quot;C:\path\to\folder&quot; (Local
			File System on Windows) or &quot;/path/to/folder&quot; (Local File System on
			Linux/MacOS and Mountpoint). For file systems connected via input port, required
			path format. You can also choose a previously selected folder from the
			drop-down list, or select a location from the &quot;Browse...&quot;
			dialog. Note that browsing is disabled in some cases:
			<ul>
				<li>
					<i>Mountpoint:</i>
					Browsing is disabled if the selected mountpoint isn't connected.
					Go to the KNIME Explorer and connect to the mountpoint to enable
					browsing.
				</li>
				<li>
					<i>File systems provided via input port:</i>
					Browsing is disabled if the connector node hasn't been executed
					since the workflow has been opened. (Re)execute the connector node
					to enable browsing.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<i>The location can be exposed as or automatically set via a 
                </i>
			<a
				href="https://docs.knime.com/latest/analytics_platform_file_handling_guide/index.html#path">
				<i>path flow variable.</i>
			</a>
		</option>
		<option name="Create missing folders">
			Select if the folders of the selected output
			location should be created if they do not already exist. If
			this option is unchecked, the node will fail if a folder does not
			exist.
		</option>
		<option name="If exists">
			Specify the behavior of the node in case the output file already
			exists.
			<ul>
				<li>
					<i>Overwrite:</i>
					Will replace any existing file.
				</li>
				<li>
					<i>Ignore:</i>
					Will ignore if a file already exists and continues the copying
					process.
				</li>
				<li>
					<i>Fail:</i>
					Will issue an error during the node's execution (to prevent
					unintentional overwrite).
				</li>
			</ul>
