	<name>CSV Writer (Preview)</name>

	<shortDescription>
		Saves a data table into an ASCII file.
	</shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
		This node writes out the input data table into a file or to a remote location denoted by an URL. The node
		provides many options to customize the output format (see below). But there is no checking done on the
		settings, so it is possible to write out the data in a format that makes it	impossible to read it in again
		(e. g. if you specify no data separator).<br />
		Note that if the destination location is a remote URL not all options are available because in general it's
		not possible to determine whether the remote location exists. In this case it will always be overwritten.
		</intro>
		<tab name="Settings">
		<description>
			General settings regarding the output file location and formats.
		</description>
		<option name="Write to">
			Select a file system in which you want to store the file. There
			are
			four default file system options to choose from:
			<br />
			<ul>
				<li>Local File System: Allows you to select a location in your
					local
					system.
				</li>
				<li>Relative to: Allows you to choose whether to resolve the path
					relative to the workflow, mountpoint or node.
				</li>
				<li>Mountpoint: Allows you to choose a mountpoint. Whenever this is
					selected, a new drop-down menu appears to choose from available
					mountpoints.
				</li>
				<li>Custom URL: Uses the standard URL handler providing the ability
					to write a file to URLs (e.g. file, http or KNIME protocol).
					Browsing is disabled for this option.
				</li>
			</ul>
			It is possible to use other file systems with this node. Therefore,
			you have to enable the file system connection input port of this node
			by clicking the
			<b>...</b>
			in the bottom left corner of the node's icon and choose
			<i>Add File System Connection port</i>
			.
			<br />
			Afterwards, you can simply connect the desired connector node to the
			reader node. The file system connection will then be shown in the
			drop down menu.
		</option>
		<option name="File/URL">
			Enter a valid destination. Depending on the selected file system this
			is either a path (used by
			<i>Local File System</i>
			,
			<i>Relative to</i>
			,
			<i>Mountpoint</i>
			options and custom file systems added by specific connector nodes) or
			a URL (used by
			<i>Custom URL</i>
			option).
			<br />
			A path usually starts with a slash (/) character and does not contain
			a protocol.
			You can also choose a previously selected file from
			the
			drop-down list, or select a destination from the
			&quot;Browse...&quot; dialog (browsing is not available for custom
			URLs).
		</option>
		<option name="Timeout (ms)">
			Timeout in milliseconds when connecting to remote resources / writing
			remote files.
			<tt>0</tt>
			means no
			timeout. In case it takes longer to connect to the host /
			write the file, the
			node fails to
			execute.
			<br />
			<i>Note</i>
			: This option is only active in case that the
			<i>Custom URL</i>
			file system is selected. Other file
			systems don't use a timeout or the
			timeout is set directly in the specific
			connector node.
		</option>
		<option name="Overwrite file if exists">Select when existing files should be
			overwritten.
			If this option is unchecked, the node will fail if a
			file already
			exists.
		</option>
		<option name="If file exists...">Specify the behavior of the node in
			case the output file already exists. <i>Overwrite</i> will replace any
			existing file, <i>Append</i> will append the input table to the end
			of the file (possibly skipping the column header) and <i>Abort</i>
			will issue an error during the node's execution (to prevent
			unintentional overwrite).</option>
		<option name="Create parent directories if required">Select when the directories of the selected output
			location should be created if they do not already exist. If this
			option is unchecked, the node will fail if a directory does not
			exist.
		</option>

		<option name="Write column header">If checked, the column names will be
			written out in the first line of the output file.
			</option>
		<option name="Don&apos;t write column headers if file exists">
			If checked, the column headers will not be written when the output
			is appended to the already existing output file.
			This is particularly useful when the CSV Writer is
			used in a loop to report results. This option is ignored
			when the column header is not written anyway or the file append option
			is unchecked (see below).
			</option>
		<option name="Write row ID">If checked, the row IDs will be
			added to the output, as first item in each line.
		</option>
		<option name="Compress output file (gzip)">Compress the output file
			in gzip format. If enabled, you will not be able to append to an
			existing file.
		</option>
		</tab>

		<tab name="Advanced">
		<description>
		In the Advanced tab, you can specify the character(s) that will be written
		out between the data items.
		</description>
		<option name="Data Separator"> You can use &quot;\t&quot; for a tab or &quot;\n&quot;
			for a new line character (and must use &quot;\\&quot; for a backslash) in
			any character sequence.
		</option>
		<option name="Missing Value Pattern">In the Advanced tab, enter a pattern
			that will be written out for missing data values. Note, the missing
			value pattern will never be put into quotes (see below).
			</option>
		<option name="Line Ending">
			In the tab "Advanced" you can select the line endings that are written to the file. Default value is the
			system default value, which is system dependent (LF on Linux/Unix systems, CR+LF on Windows systems). You
			can enforce a certain line ending to generate a file that is readable on a different operating system.
		</option>
		</tab>
		<tab name="Quotes">
		<description>In the Quotes tab, you can enter a left
			and right quotation mark pattern. Also, select a mode, which determines
			when quotation marks should be placed around the data item. When quotes
			are used (in every mode other than &quot;never&quot;) you must also specify a
			replacement pattern for the right quote. If it appears in the data
			item, it must be replaced (so it won&apos;t be confused with the actual
			closing quote).
		</description>
		<option name="Quote Mode: always">Every data item written out is
			placed between quotation marks. (The missing value pattern is not
			quoted though.)
			</option>
		<option name="Quote Mode: if needed">Quotes are only placed around a
			data item that contains the data separator (specified in the Advanced
			tab) or if it equals the missing value pattern. The right quote pattern
			will be replaced if it appears in a quoted data item.
			</option>
		<option name="Quote Mode: non-numerical only">Integer and floating point
			numbers are not quoted, all other data items are. (Selecting the decimal
			point as data separator will lead to an output that can&apos;t be read in
			again.) The right quote is replaced in quoted items.
			</option>
		<option name="Quote Mode: never">No data item is placed between quotation
			marks. You should specify a replacement pattern for the data separator,
			if it occurs in the data item.
			</option>
		</tab>
		<tab name="Comment Header">
		<description>In the Comment Header tab you can add a
			comment header to the beginning of the output. Either specify your
			own comment line(s) or choose from the predefined items.
			If you check one of the options you must also enter a comment begin
			and comment end pattern.
		</description>
		<option name="Header Content: the current creation time">If checked, a
			comment line with the current time and date is added.
			</option>
		<option name="Header Content: the user account name">If checked, the login
			name of the user that created the file (probably you!) is inserted.
			</option>
		<option name="Header Content: the input table name">If checked, a comment
			line is added showing the name of the table the data was read from.
			</option>
		<option name="Header Content: this text">If you check this, you can enter
			any text, that will be added then to the comment header. Use &quot;\n&quot; to
			start a new line, and &quot;\t&quot; to insert a tab character (and &quot;\\&quot; to
			produce a backslash).
			</option>
		<option name="Comment Pattern">
			If you have checked at least one of the content options, you must
			provide comment begin and end patterns that are placed around the
			comment header then. If you omit the end pattern the begin pattern
			is placed at the beginning of each comment line (assuming single
			line comments, in contrast to block comment if you specify both
			patterns).
			</option>
		<option name="Comment Indentation">
			If you have checked at least one of the content options, you can
			specify an indentation string, i.e., a prefix for every comment line.
		</option>
		</tab>
		<tab name="Number Format">
		<description>
			In the tab "Number Format" you can define the decimal separator and
			whether scientific notation should be used.
		</description>
		<option name="Decimal Separator">
			Here you can enter a character that is used as decimal separator for
			floating point numbers. It replaces the default character '.' then.
		</option>
		<option name="Scientific Notation">
			Check this if you want very large and very small floating point
			numbers to be written in scientific notation (e.g., 1.0E9 instead of
			1,000,000,000).
		</option>
		</tab>
		<tab name="Encoding">
			<option name="File Encoding">
				To write a csv file with a different encoding, you can select a character set in this tab (UTF-8,
				UTF-16, etc.), or specify any other encoding supported by your Java VM. The default value uses the default
				encoding of the Java VM, which may depend on the locale or the Java property &quot;file.encoding&quot;
