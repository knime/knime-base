	<name>Create Temp Dir (Labs) </name>
	<shortDescription>Creates a temporary directory upon execute and exposes its path as flow variable.      </shortDescription>
	<fullDescription>
		<intro>Creates a temporary directory upon execute and exposes its path
			as flow variable. This can be useful in (a) demo application where
			the actual path of the output is not all that relevant, e.g. the
			KNIME public workflow server and (b) KNIME WebPortal and quickform
			flows, where some data is written, which is later downloaded by means
			of, e.g. a web link. The directory is deleted upon closing the
			workflow. The node can be also configured in a way that the created
			temporary directory is deleted upon reset.
		</intro>
		<option name="Write to">
			Select a file system in which you want to store the file. There are
			four default file system options to choose from:
			<br />
			<ul>
				<li>Local File System: Allows you to select a location in your local
					system.
				</li>
				<li>Relative to: Allows you to choose whether to resolve the path
					relative to the workflow, mountpoint or node.
				</li>
				<li>Mountpoint: Allows you to choose a mountpoint. Whenever this is
					selected, a new drop-down menu appears to choose from available
					mountpoints.
				</li>
			</ul>
			It is possible to use other file systems with this node. Therefore,
			you have to enable the file system connection input port of this node
			by clicking the
			<b>...</b>
			in the bottom left corner of the node's icon and choose
			<i>Add File System Connection port</i>
			.
			<br />
			Afterwards, you can simply connect the desired connector node to the
			reader node. The file system connection will then be shown in the
			drop down menu.
		</option>
		<option name="Folder">
			Enter a valid destination directory where the temporary directory
			will be created at. Depending on the selected file system this is
			either a directory path (used by
			<i>Local File System</i>
			,
			<i>Relative to</i>
			,
			<i>Mountpoint</i>
			options and custom file systems added by specific connector nodes) or
			a URL (used by
			<i>Custom URL</i>
			option).
			<br />
			A path usually starts with a slash (/) character and does not contain
			a protocol. You can also choose a previously selected file from the
			drop-down list, or select a destination from the
			&quot;Browse...&quot; dialog (browsing is not available for custom
			URLs).
		</option>
		<option name="Create parent directories">Select when the directories of the selected output
			location should be created if they do not already exist. If this
			option is unchecked, the node will fail if a directory does not
			exist.
		</option>
		<option name="Delete temp directory on reset">Check this box to delete the directory and all its
			content when the node is reset.
		</option>
		<option name="Temp directory prefix">Name prefix of the temporary directory. It will be
			amended by some random number to ensure uniqueness.
		</option>
		<option name="Export path as (variable name)">The name of the exported variable denoting the
			actual path of the created temporary directory.
		</option>
		<option name="More path variables">A list of additional variables that will be
			created by the node. Each variable will denote a path to a file (as
			opposed to a directory path), whereby the file name is given in the
			second (Filename) column
