	<shortDescription>
		Writes a PMML model into a PMML compliant file.
	</shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			This nodes writes a PMML model from a PMML model port into a PMML
			v4.2 compliant
			file or to a remote location denoted by an URL. If a
			PMML file from
			another version is read by the PMML Reader and
			directly
			written by this node, it is converted into PMML v4.2.
			If the model is
			not valid (unknown data types, etc.) an exception is
			thrown during
			execution.
		</intro>
		<option name="Write to">
			Select a file system in which you want to store the file. There
			are
			four default file system options to choose from:
			<br />
			<ul>
				<li>Local File System: Allows you to select a location in your
					local
					system.
				</li>
				<li>Relative to: Allows you to choose whether to resolve the path
					relative to the workflow, mountpoint or node.
				</li>
				<li>Mountpoint: Allows you to choose a mountpoint. Whenever this is
					selected, a new drop-down menu appears to choose from available
					mountpoints.
				</li>
				<li>Custom URL: Uses the standard URL handler providing the ability
					to write a file to URLs (e.g. file, http or KNIME protocol).
					Browsing is disabled for this option.
				</li>
			</ul>
			It is possible to use other file systems with this node. Therefore,
			you have to enable the file system connection input port of this node
			by clicking the
			<b>...</b>
			in the bottom left corner of the node's icon and choose
			<i>Add File System Connection port</i>
			.
			<br />
			Afterwards, you can simply connect the desired connector node to the
			reader node. The file system connection will then be shown in the
			drop down menu.
		</option>
		<option name="File/URL">
			Enter a valid destination. Depending on the selected file system this
			is either a path (used by
			<i>Local File System</i>
			,
			<i>Relative to</i>
			,
			<i>Mountpoint</i>
			options and custom file systems added by specific connector nodes) or
			a URL (used by
			<i>Custom URL</i>
			option).
			<br />
			A path usually starts with a slash (/) character and does not contain
			a protocol.
			You can also choose a previously selected file from
			the
			drop-down list, or select a destination from the
			&quot;Browse...&quot; dialog (browsing is not available for custom
			URLs).
		</option>
		<option name="Timeout (ms)">
			Timeout in milliseconds when writing remote files.
			<tt>0</tt>
			means no
			timeout. In case it takes longer to connect to the host, the
			node fails to
			execute.
			<br />
			<i>Note</i>
			: This option is only active in case that the
			<i>Custom URL</i>
			or
			<i>Relative to</i>
			file system is selected. Other file
			systems don't use a timeout or the
			timeout is set directly in the specific
			connector node.
		</option>
		<option name="Overwrite file if exists">Select when existing files should be
			overwritten.
			If this option is unchecked, the node will fail if a
			file already
			exists.
		</option>
		<option name="Create parent directories if required">Select when the directories of the selected output
			location should be created if they do not already exist. If this
			option is unchecked, the node will fail if a directory does not
			exist.
		</option>
		<option name="Validate PMML before export">Select to validate the PMML document that should
			be written. If it is not compliant with the schema, the node will
			fail before actually writing.
		</option>
