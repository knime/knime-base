				node
				has
				got an optional input port for a File System connection
				which
				can
				be
				used to delete files and folders on different file
				systems.
				<b>Note
					that if the node is connected to a file system all
					paths will be
					resolved against the connected file system. In case the
					input column
					contains a path from a connected file system and no
					filesystem
					connection is connected, the node will fail during
					execution.
